# Âµslapcode
a tiny version of [slapcode](https://github.com/slbsh/slapcode).  
Easy, bite sized challanges for my boy carl.  

Just like in slapcode each problem has it's own README which adds upon the global rules.  
Each problem will have resources in the README. Some may also have a hints direcory.

## Rulz
- Follow the spirit of the problems
- May not modify Cargo.toml
- Try to optimize and make your code readable
- no clippy warns. Some BS ones may be ignored, just do what's best.
- Avoid googling full terms or using llms cause those may give full solutions, which is no fun to all :p
- Rust/crate docs, Rust book, and wikipedia are always fair game
